         desc:"This leave-on exfoliant gently removes built-up layers of dead skin, revealing smoother, softer skin from the neck down. It also significantly improves the appearance of hard, clogged, red bumps on arms and legs.",

It beautifully hydrates skin and softens dryness anywhere on the body.",
         what:"The creamy, antioxidant-rich formula leaves skin feeling thoroughly hydrated and moisturized, and goes beyond to gently exfoliate and visibly improve rough skin with a 10% concentration of glycolic acid. Daily use helps to visibly improve uneven skin tone and soften the appearance of hard, clogged, red bumps on the arms and legs. Is a customer favorite even for those with skin prone to keratosis pilaris.",
         how:"Apply a small amount to clean skin. May be used daily for all-over smoothing, or applied as a spot treatment where needed. Apply this treatment first when using with an additional moisturizer. For daytime, follow with a broad-spectrum sunscreen rated SPF 30 or greater. Do not apply to just-shaved skin. Sun Protection Advice When Using Any AHA Exfoliant: RESIST Skin Revealing 10% AHA Lotion contains 10% glycolic acid, an ingredient that may increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun and the possibility of sunburn. Always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen rated SPF 30 or greater every day. When outdoors, wear protective clothing whenever possible, seek shade, and avoid prolonged sun exposure.",
