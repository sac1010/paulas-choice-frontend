#Paula's Choice
This is a clone of Paula's Choice which is basically a skincare website which provides different types of skin care products for both men and women.
This project was assigned to a team of 6 members and we have completed it in a time span of 5 days.
We have used HTML CSS ADVANCED JAVASCRIPT ES6.
We all have contributed in this project.
User can sign up and sign in and then can find his/her name on the top right corner of the website.
When user needs to buy a product they can select it from different categories and also the products can be filtered on the basis of top ratings, reviews and most relevant.
One can sort the products according to their differnt categories like RESIST, DULL SKIN, CLINICAL, CLEAR, BODY CARE, MEN'S, SKIN PERFECTING etc.
Every product has its elaborated detail,it contains its youtube video, reasearch on it, ingredients used in it, why to use, how to use, what is it good for.. and also user can comment on the product if he/she likes it and give ratings and reviews.
User can add them to cart and also increase/decrease the quantity, they can even remove or save it for later. 
After that one can do the payment by any method they are comfortable with, by filling the address and card details.
We have made this project keeping in mind the user flow, and it is also responsive.


We are delighted to work on such project in a team and we are looking forward to work on more such projects in future as well.
