# Paula's Choice
<p>This is clone of Paula's Choice website
We have made this project in a time span of 5 days in construct week
The homepage has much to explore as it can direct to skin care routine page.
It also has Paula's choice philosophy and also have guidelines on how to handle covid.
It has also contains authentication functionality and on signing in user can see his/her name on top right corner of the page.
In the product page you can see varities of products.
This is basically a cosmetic and skin care website where user can sort the products on the basis of differnt categories like RESIST, CALM, SKIN PERFECTING, CLEAR etc.
The product page also have the filter option where one can sort the products by ratings, reviews and most relevant.
When one clicks on the product he/she can see each and every detail of that product on the individual product page like research, ingredients used in it, why to use how to use etc.
Then the user can add it to cart where the product's quantity can be increased or decreased. User can remove the product or save it for later. 
Then comes the payment page where after filling the details like address, payment details, one can pay by any method he/she is comfortable with.
Once the process is done the user can return back to the homepage and explore more.



We are delighted to work on this project and are looking forward to work on more such projects in future.
